# py-ciu

*Explainable Machine Learning through Contextual Importance and Utility*

The *py-ciu* library provides methods to generate post-hoc explanations for
machine learning-based classifiers.
It is model agnostic and answers the following questions, given a classification
decision:

* How **important** is a specific feature or feature combination for the
  classification decision? (Contextual Importance, CI)

* How **typical** is a specific feature or feature combination for the
  given class? (Contextual Utility, CU)


## Usage

Install *py-ciu* with ``pip install py-ciu``.
