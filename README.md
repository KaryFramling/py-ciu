# py-ciu

*Explainable Machine Learning through Contextual Importance and Utility*

The *py-ciu* library provides methods to generate post-hoc explanations for
machine learning-based classifiers.

**NOTE: This implementation is the result of a major rewrite made in November/December 2023. This was made in order to make the use of this py-ciu package similar to the [R CIU](https://github.com/KaryFramling/ciu) and [py.ciu.image](https://github.com/KaryFramling/py.ciu.image) (re-written in Nov 2023) packages. Also, the core CIU development is still done in "R" and some of the functionality present in the R version may not be available in this python version.**

The version of py-ciu that has been replaced on 12 January 2024 is available in the branch `VersionUntilNov2023`.

## Usage

First install the `py-ciu` package. The recommended approach is to clone this repository and use it from there. The current version has been tested with Python versions 3.11.5 and 3.12.1. More extensive testing against different versions will be performed in the future. 

The other approach is to install it using `pip install py-ciu` but since the development of CIU is sometimes quite rapid, you should not except that all functionality is available in that version.

A quick overview of the use of py-ciu with different datasets amd ML models is available as a Jupyter notebook [README_notebook.ipynb](README_notebook.ipynb). All the notebooks have been ran in Visual Studio Code, presumably with the latest versions of all packages. There will be errors or strange results in case of library version mismatches and that seems to happen quite frequently for Python libraries. So if your results are not identical to the ones that you see in these notebooks, then you probably have to update some/many libraries in your installation. 

Other notebooks available in the repository are:

- [BostonTests.ipynb](BostonTests.ipynb): Examples of py-ciu use for Boston data set. This notebook provides a good overview of CIU capabilities for a regression task. 
- [TitanicTests.ipynb](TitanicTests.ipynb): Examples of py-ciu use for Titanic data set. This notebook provides a good overview of CIU capabilities for a classification task. It also gives a small example of the use of CIU's "intermediate concepts". 
- [AmesHousingTests.ipynb](AmesHousingTests.ipynb): Examples of py-ciu use for Ames housing data set. This data set has 80 input features and provides a good example of the use of CIU's "intermediate concepts", as well as why they are necessary in order to give "correct" explanations even in the presence of dependencies between features (which is also the case for Titanic). 
- [IrisTests.ipynb](IrisTests.ipynb): Examples of py-ciu use for Iris data set. This notebook includes some "low-level" use of the package that may not be found in the other notebooks. 
- [Beeswarms.ipynb](Beeswarms.ipynb): Examples of beeswarm plots as a means of "global explanation" by visualising importance/influence/utility/whatever for a set of instances.
- [ContrastiveTests.ipynb](ContrastiveTests.ipynb): Examples of contrastive "Why A and not B?" and ""Why not B but rather A?" explanations. 
- [RunTests.ipynb](RunTests.ipynb): Notebook for running various tests that are found in the `ciu_tests` directory. 

A Sphinx-generated documentation (presumably up-to-date) in PDF is accessible at [docs/py-ciu.pdf](docs/py-ciu.pdf). Github doesn't want to show the HTML documentation as a web page, still need to find a good solution for that.  

# What is CIU?

**Remark**: It seems like Github Markdown doesn’t show correctly the “{”
and “}” characters in Latex equations, whereas they are shown correctly
in Rstudio. Therefore, in most cases where there is an $i$ shown in
Github, it actually signifies `{i}` and where there is an $I$ it
signifies `{I}`.

CIU is a model-agnostic method for producing outcome explanations of
results of any “black-box” model `y=f(x)`. CIU directly estimates two
elements of explanation by observing the behaviour of the black-box
model (without creating any “surrogate” model `g` of `f(x)`).

**Contextual Importance (CI)** answers the question: ***how much can the
result (or the utility of it) change as a function of feature*** $i$ or a
set of features $\{i\}$ jointly, in the context $x$?

**Contextual Utility (CU)** answers the question: ***how favorable is the
current value*** of feature $i$ (or a set of features $\{i\}$ jointly) for a good
(high-utility) result, in the context $x$?

CI of one feature or a set of features (jointly) $\{i\}$ compared to a
superset of features $\{I\}$ is defined as

$$
\omega_{j,\{i\},\{I\}}(x)=\frac{umax_{j}(x,\{i\})-umin_{j}(x,\{i\})}{umax_{j}(x,\{I\})-umin_{j}(x,\{I\})},  
$$

where $\{i\} \subseteq \{I\}$ and $\{I\} \subseteq \{1,\dots,n\}$. $x$
is the instance/context to be explained and defines the values of input
features that do not belong to $\{i\}$ or $\{I\}$. In practice, CI is
calculated as:

$$
\omega_{j,\{i\},\{I\}}(x)= \frac{ymax_{j,\{i\}}(x)-ymin_{j,\{i\}}(x)}{ ymax_{j,\{I\}}(x)-ymin_{j,\{I\}}(x)}, 
$$

where $ymin_{j}()$ and $ymax_{j}()$ are the minimal and maximal $y_{j}$
values observed for output $j$.

CU is defined as

$$
CU_{j,\{i\}}(x)=\frac{u_{j}(x)-umin_{j,\{i\}}(x)}{umax_{j,\{i\}}(x)-umin_{j,\{i\}}(x)}. 
$$

When $u_{j}(y_{j})=Ay_{j}+b$, this can be written as:

$$
CU_{j,\{i\}}(x)=\left|\frac{ y_{j}(x)-yumin_{j,\{i\}}(x)}{ymax_{j,\{i\}}(x)-ymin_{j,\{i\}}(x)}\right|, 
$$

where $yumin=ymin$ if $A$ is positive and $yumin=ymax$ if $A$ is
negative.

There are also two implementations of CIU for explaining images:

- Python: <https://github.com/KaryFramling/py.ciu.image>
- R: <https://github.com/KaryFramling/ciu.image>

Future work on image explanation will presumably focus on the Python version, due to the extensive use of deep neural networks that tend to be implemented mainly for Python.
